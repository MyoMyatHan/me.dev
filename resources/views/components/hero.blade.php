        if you’re going to try, go all the
        way. <br>
        otherwise, don’t even start.<br>

        if you’re going to try, go all the
        way.<br>
        this could mean losing girlfriends,<br>
        wives, relatives, jobs and<br>
        maybe your mind.<br>

        go all the way.<br>
        it could mean not eating for 3 or 4 days.<br>
        it could mean freezing on a
        park bench.<br>
        it could mean jail,<br>
        it could mean derision,<br>
        mockery,
        isolation.<br>
        isolation is the gift,<br>
        all the others are a test of your<br>
        endurance, of<br>
        how much you really want to<br>
        do it.<br>
        and you’ll do it<br>
        despite rejection and the worst odds<br>
        and it will be better than<br>
        anything else<br>
        you can imagine.<br>

        if you’re going to try,<br>
        go all the way.<br>
        there is no other feeling like<br>
        that.<br>
        you will be alone with the gods<br>
        and the nights will flame with<br>
        fire.<br>

        do it, do it, do it.<br>
        do it.<br>

        all the way<br>
        all the way.<br>

        you will ride life straight to<br>
        perfect laughter, its<br>
        the only good fight<br>
        there is.
